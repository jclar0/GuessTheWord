## How to play

You input a five-letter word, and the game will tell you whether the word is alphabetically before or after the chosen word. The game will **choose a word at random** each time it is started, so there is no one right answer!

If you don't have the word after five attempts, the game will give you a handy hint, which should help steer you in the right direction to get the word!
